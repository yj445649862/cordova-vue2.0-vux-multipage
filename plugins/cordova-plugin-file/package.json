(_iOS_, _Android_, _BlackBerry 10_, _OSX_, _windows_)\n\n* `cordova.file.applicationStorageDirectory` - Root directory of the application's\n  sandbox; on iOS & windows this location is read-only (but specific subdirectories [like\n  `/Documents` on iOS or `/localState` on windows] are read-write). All data contained within\n  is private to the app. (_iOS_, _Android_, _BlackBerry 10_, _OSX_)\n\n* `cordova.file.dataDirectory` - Persistent and private data storage within the\n  application's sandbox using internal memory (on Android, if you need to use\n  external memory, use `.externalDataDirectory`). On iOS, this directory is not\n  synced with iCloud (use `.syncedDataDirectory`). (_iOS_, _Android_, _BlackBerry 10_, _windows_)\n\n* `cordova.file.cacheDirectory` -  Directory for cached data files or any files\n  that your app can re-create easily. The OS may delete these files when the device\n  runs low on storage, nevertheless, apps should not rely on the OS to delete files\n  in here. (_iOS_, _Android_, _BlackBerry 10_, _OSX_, _windows_)\n\n* `cordova.file.externalApplicationStorageDirectory` - Application space on\n  external storage. (_Android_)\n\n* `cordova.file.externalDataDirectory` - Where to put app-specific data files on\n  external storage. (_Android_)\n\n* `cordova.file.externalCacheDirectory` - Application cache on external storage.\n  (_Android_)\n\n* `cordova.file.externalRootDirectory` - External storage (SD card) root. (_Android_, _BlackBerry 10_)\n\n* `cordova.file.tempDirectory` - Temp directory that the OS can clear at will. Do not\n  rely on the OS to clear this directory; your app should always remove files as\n  applicable. (_iOS_, _OSX_, _windows_)\n\n* `cordova.file.syncedDataDirectory` - Holds app-specific files that should be synced\n  (e.g. to iCloud). (_iOS_, _windows_)\n\n* `cordova.file.documentsDirectory` - Files private to the app, but that are meaningful\n  to other application (e.g. Office files). Note that for _OSX_ this is the user's `~/Documents` directory. (_iOS_, _OSX_)\n\n* `cordova.file.sharedDirectory` - Files globally available to all applications (_BlackBerry 10_)\n\n## File System Layouts\n\nAlthough technically an implementation detail, it can be very useful to know how\nthe `cordova.file.*` properties map to physical paths on a real device.\n\n### iOS File System Layout\n\n| Device Path                                    | `cordova.file.*`            | `iosExtraFileSystems` | r/w? | persistent? | OS clears | sync | private |\n|:-----------------------------------------------|:----------------------------|:----------------------|:----:|:-----------:|:---------:|:----:|:-------:|\n| `/var/mobile/Applications/<UUID>/`             | applicationStorageDirectory | -                     | r    |     N/A     |     N/A   | N/A  |   Yes   |\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`appname.app/`               | applicationDirectory        | bundle                | r    |     N/A     |     N/A   | N/A  |   Yes   |\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`www/`     | -                           | -                     | r    |     N/A     |     N/A   | N/A  |   Yes   |\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Documents/`                 | documentsDirectory          | documents             | r/w  |     Yes     |     No    | Yes  |   Yes   |\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`NoCloud/` | -                           | documents-nosync      | r/w  |     Yes     |     No    | No   |   Yes   |\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Library`                    | -                           | library               | r/w  |     Yes     |     No    | Yes? |   Yes   |\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`NoCloud/` | dataDirectory               | library-nosync        | r/w  |     Yes     |     No    | No   |   Yes   |\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Cloud/`   | syncedDataDirectory         | -                     | r/w  |     Yes     |     No    | Yes  |   Yes   |\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`Caches/`  | cacheDirectory              | cache                 | r/w  |     Yes*    |  Yes\\*\\*\\*| No   |   Yes   |\n| &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`tmp/`                       | tempDirectory               | -                     | r/w  |     No\\*\\*  |  Yes\\*\\*\\*| No   |   Yes   |\n\n\n  \\* Files persist across app restarts and upgrades, but this directory can\n     be cleared whenever the OS desires.

See [this page](http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html)\nfor an extensive discussion of the various possibilities.\n\nPrevious versions of the plugin would choose the location of the temporary and\npersistent files on startup, based on whether the device claimed that the SD\nCard (or equivalent storage partition) was mounted. If the SD Card was mounted,\nor if a large internal storage partition was available (such as on Nexus\ndevices,) then the persistent files would be stored in the root of that space.\nThis meant that all Cordova apps could see all of the files available on the\ncard.\n\nIf the SD card was not available, then previous versions would store data under\n`/data/data/<packageId>`, which isolates apps from each other, but may still\ncause data to be shared between users.\n\nIt is now possible to choose whether to store files in the internal file\nstorage location, or using the previous logic, with a preference in your\napplication's `config.xml` file. To do this, add one of these two lines to\n`config.xml`:\n\n    <preference name=\"AndroidPersistentFileLocation\" value=\"Internal\" />\n\n    <preference name=\"AndroidPersistentFileLocation\" value=\"Compatibility\" />\n\nWithout this line, the File plugin will use `Internal` as the default. If\na preference tag is present, and is not one of these values, the application\nwill not start.\n\nIf your application has previously been shipped to users, using an older (pre-\n3.0.0) version of this plugin, and has stored files in the persistent filesystem,\nthen you should set the preference to `Compatibility` if your config.xml does not specify a location for the persistent filesystem. Switching the location to\n\"Internal\" would mean that existing users who upgrade their application may be\nunable to access their previously-stored files, depending on their device.\n\nIf your application is new, or has never previously stored files in the\npersistent filesystem, then the `Internal` setting is generally recommended.\n\n### Slow recursive operations for /android_asset\n\nListing asset directories is really slow on Android. You can speed it up though, by\nadding `src/android/build-extras.gradle` to the root of your android project (also\nrequires cordova-android@4.0.0 or greater).\n\n## iOS Quirks\n\n- `cordova.file.applicationStorageDirectory` is read-only; attempting to store\n  files within the root directory will fail. Use one of the other `cordova.file.*`\n  properties defined for iOS (only `applicationDirectory` and `applicationStorageDirectory` are\n  read-only).\n- `FileReader.readAsText(blob, encoding)`\n  - The `encoding` parameter is not supported, and UTF-8 encoding is always in effect.\n\n### iOS Persistent storage location\n\nThere are two valid locations to store persistent files on an iOS device: the\nDocuments directory and the Library directory. Previous versions of the plugin\nonly ever stored persistent files in the Documents directory. This had the\nside-effect of making all of an application's files visible in iTunes, which\nwas often unintended, especially for applications which handle lots of small\nfiles, rather than producing complete documents for export, which is the\nintended purpose of the directory.\n\nIt is now possible to choose whether to store files in the documents or library\ndirectory, with a preference in your application's `config.xml` file. To do this,\nadd one of these two lines to `config.xml`:\n\n    <preference name=\"iosPersistentFileLocation\" value=\"Library\" />\n\n    <preference name=\"iosPersistentFileLocation\" value=\"Compatibility\" />\n\nWithout this line, the File plugin will use `Compatibility` as the default. If\na preference tag is present, and is not one of these values, the application\nwill not start.\n\nIf your application has previously been shipped to users, using an older (pre-\n1.0) version of this plugin, and has stored files in the persistent filesystem,\nthen you should set the preference to `Compatibility`. Switching the location to\n`Library` would mean that existing users who upgrade their application would be\nunable to access their previously-stored files.\n\nIf your application is new, or has never previously stored files in the\npersistent filesystem, then the `Library` setting is generally recommended.\n\n## Firefox OS Quirks\n\nThe File System API is not natively supported by Firefox OS and is implemented\nas a shim on top of indexedDB.\n\n* Does not fail when removing non-empty directories\n* Does not support metadata for directories\n* Methods `copyTo` and `moveTo` do not support directories\n\nThe following data paths are supported:\n* `applicationDirectory` - Uses `xhr` to get local files that are packaged with the app.\n* `dataDirectory` - For persistent app-specific data files.\n* `cacheDirectory` - Cached files that should survive app restarts (Apps should not rely\non the OS to delete files in here).\n\n## Browser Quirks\n\n### Common quirks and remarks\n- Each browser uses its own sandboxed filesystem. IE and Firefox use IndexedDB as a base.\nAll browsers use forward slash as directory separator in a path.\n- Directory entries have to be created successively.\nFor example, the call `fs.root.getDirectory('dir1/dir2', {create:true}, successCallback, errorCallback)`\nwill fail if dir1 did not exist.\n- The plugin requests user permission to use persistent storage at the application first start.\n- Plugin supports `cdvfile://localhost` (local resources) only. I.e. external resources are not supported via `cdvfile`.\n- The plugin does not follow [\"File System API 8.3 Naming restrictions\"](http://www.w3.org/TR/2011/WD-file-system-api-20110419/#naming-restrictions).\n- Blob and File' `close` function is not supported.\n- `FileSaver` and `BlobBuilder` are not supported by this plugin and don't have stubs.\n- The plugin does not support `requestAllFileSystems`. This function is also missing in the specifications.\n- Entries in directory will not be removed if you use `create: true` flag for existing directory.\n- Files created via constructor are not supported. You should use entry.file method instead.\n- Each browser uses its own form for blob URL references.\n- `readAsDataURL` function is supported, but the mediatype in Chrome depends on entry name extension,\nmediatype in IE is always empty (which is the same as `text-plain` according the specification),\nthe mediatype in Firefox is always `application/octet-stream`.\nFor example, if the content is `abcdefg` then Firefox returns `data:application/octet-stream;base64,YWJjZGVmZw==`,\nIE returns `data:;base64,YWJjZGVmZw==`, Chrome returns `data:<mediatype depending on extension of entry name>;base64,YWJjZGVmZw==`.\n- `toInternalURL` returns the path in the form `file:///persistent/path/to/entry` (Firefox, IE).\nChrome returns the path in the form `cdvfile://localhost/persistent/file`.\n\n### Chrome quirks\n- Chrome filesystem is not immediately ready after device ready event. As a workaround you can subscribe to `filePluginIsReady` event.\nExample:\n```javascript\nwindow.addEventListener('filePluginIsReady', function(){ console.log('File plugin is ready');}, false);\n```\nYou can use `window.isFilePluginReadyRaised` function to check whether event was already raised.\n- window.requestFileSystem TEMPORARY and PERSISTENT filesystem quotas are not limited in Chrome.\n- To increase persistent storage in Chrome you need to call `window.initPersistentFileSystem` method. Persistent storage quota is 5 MB by default.\n- Chrome requires `--allow-file-access-from-files` run argument to support API via `file:///` protocol.\n- `File` object will be not changed if you use flag `{create:true}` when getting an existing `Entry`.\n- events `cancelable` property is set to true in Chrome. This is contrary to the [specification](http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/file-system/file-writer.html).\n- `toURL` function in Chrome returns `filesystem:`-prefixed path depending on application host.\nFor example, `filesystem:file:///persistent/somefile.txt`, `filesystem:http://localhost:8080/persistent/somefile.txt`.\n- `toURL` function result does not contain trailing slash in case of directory entry.\nChrome resolves directories with slash-trailed urls correctly though.\n- `resolveLocalFileSystemURL` method requires the inbound `url` to have `filesystem` prefix. For example, `url` parameter for `resolveLocalFileSystemURL`\nshould be in the form `filesystem:file:///persistent/somefile.txt` as opposed to the form `file:///persistent/somefile.txt` in Android.\n- Deprecated `toNativeURL` function is not supported and does not have a stub.\n- `setMetadata` function is not stated in the specifications and not supported.\n- INVALID_MODIFICATION_ERR (code: 9) is thrown instead of SYNTAX_ERR(code: 8) on requesting of a non-existant filesystem.\n- INVALID_MODIFICATION_ERR (code: 9) is thrown instead of PATH_EXISTS_ERR(code: 12) on trying to exclusively create a file or directory, which already exists.\n- INVALID_MODIFICATION_ERR (code: 9) is thrown instead of  NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR(code: 6) on trying to call removeRecursively on the root file system.\n- INVALID_MODIFICATION_ERR (code: 9) is thrown instead of NOT_FOUND_ERR(code: 1) on trying to moveTo directory that does not exist.\n\n### IndexedDB-based impl quirks (Firefox and IE)\n- `.` and `..` are not supported.\n- IE does not support `file:///`-mode; only hosted mode is supported (http://localhost:xxxx).\n- Firefox filesystem size is not limited but each 50MB extension will request a user permission.\nIE10 allows up to 10mb of combined AppCache and IndexedDB used in implementation of filesystem without prompting,\nonce you hit that level you will be asked if you want to allow it to be increased up to a max of 250mb per site.\nSo `size` parameter for `requestFileSystem` function does not affect filesystem in Firefox and IE.\n- `readAsBinaryString` function is not stated in the Specs and not supported in IE and does not have a stub.\n- `file.type` is always null.\n- You should not create entry using DirectoryEntry instance callback result which was deleted.\nOtherwise, you will get a 'hanging entry'.\n- Before you can read a file, which was just written you need to get a new instance of this file.\n- `setMetadata` function, which is not stated in the Specs supports `modificationTime` field change only.\n- `copyTo` and `moveTo` functions do not support directories.\n- Directories metadata is not supported.\n- Both Entry.remove and directoryEntry.removeRecursively don't fail when removing\nnon-empty directories - directories being removed are cleaned along with contents instead.\n- `abort` and `truncate` functions are not supported.\n- progress events are not fired. For example, this handler will be not executed:\n```javascript\nwriter.onprogress = function() { /*commands*/ };\n```\n\n## Upgrading Notes\n\nIn v1.0.0 of this plugin, the `FileEntry` and `DirectoryEntry` structures have changed,\nto be more in line with the published specification.\n\nPrevious (pre-1.0.0) versions of the plugin stored the device-absolute-file-location\nin the `fullPath` property of `Entry` objects. These paths would typically look like\n\n    /var/mobile/Applications/<application UUID>/Documents/path/to/file  (iOS)\n    /storage/emulated/0/path/to/file                                    (Android)\n\nThese paths were also returned by the `toURL()` method of the `Entry` objects.\n\nWith v1.0.0, the `fullPath` attribute is the path to the file, _relative to the root of\nthe HTML filesystem_. So, the above paths would now both be represented by a `FileEntry`\nobject with a `fullPath` of\n\n    /path/to/file\n\nIf your application works with device-absolute-paths, and you previously retrieved those\npaths through the `fullPath` property of `Entry` objects, then you should update your code\nto use `entry.toURL()` instead.\n\nFor backwards compatibility, the `resolveLocalFileSystemURL()` method will accept a\ndevice-absolute-path, and will return an `Entry` object corresponding to it, as long as that\nfile exists within either the `TEMPORARY` or `PERSISTENT` filesystems.\n\nThis has particularly been an issue with the File-Transfer plugin, which previously used\ndevice-absolute-paths (and can still accept them). It has been updated to work correctly\nwith FileSystem URLs, so replacing `entry.fullPath` with `entry.toURL()` should resolve any\nissues getting that plugin to work with files on the device.\n\nIn v1.1.0 the return value of `toURL()` was changed (see [CB-6394](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/CB-6394))\nto return an absolute 'file://' URL. wherever possible. To ensure a 'cdvfile:'-URL you can use `toInternalURL()` now.\nThis method will now return filesystem URLs of the form\n\n    cdvfile://localhost/persistent/path/to/file\n\nwhich can be used to identify the file uniquely.\n\n## cdvfile protocol\n**Purpose**\n\n`cdvfile://localhost/persistent|temporary|another-fs-root*/path/to/file` can be used for platform-independent file paths.\ncdvfile paths are supported by core plugins - for example you can download an mp3 file to cdvfile-path via `cordova-plugin-file-transfer` and play it via `cordova-plugin-media`.\n\n__*Note__: See [Where to Store Files](#where-to-store-files), [File System Layouts](#file-system-layouts) and [Configuring the Plugin](#configuring-the-plugin-optional) for more details about available fs roots.\n\nTo use `cdvfile` as a tag' `src` you can convert it to native path via `toURL()` method of the resolved fileEntry, which you can get via `resolveLocalFileSystemURL` - see examples below.\n\nYou can also use `cdvfile://` paths directly in the DOM, for example:\n```HTML\n<img src=\"cdvfile://localhost/persistent/img/logo.png\" />\n```\n\n__Note__: This method requires following Content Security rules updates:\n* Add `cdvfile:` scheme to `Content-Security-Policy` meta tag of the index page, e.g.:\n  - `<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Security-Policy\" content=\"default-src 'self' data: gap: `**cdvfile:**` https://ssl.gstatic.com 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; media-src *\">`\n* Add `<access origin=\"cdvfile://*\" />` to `config.xml`.\n\n**Converting cdvfile:// to native path**\n\n```javascript\nresolveLocalFileSystemURL('cdvfile://localhost/temporary/path/to/file.mp4', function(entry) {\n    var nativePath = entry.toURL();\n    console.log('Native URI: ' + nativePath);\n    document.getElementById('video').src = nativePath;\n```\n\n**Converting native path to cdvfile://**\n\n```javascript\nresolveLocalFileSystemURL(nativePath, function(entry) {\n    console.log('cdvfile URI: ' + entry.toInternalURL());\n```\n\n**Using cdvfile in core plugins**\n\n```javascript\nfileTransfer.download(uri, 'cdvfile://localhost/temporary/path/to/file.mp3', function (entry) { ...\n```\n```javascript\nvar my_media = new Media('cdvfile://localhost/temporary/path/to/file.mp3', ...);\nmy_media.play();\n```\n\n#### cdvfile quirks\n- Using `cdvfile://` paths in the DOM is not supported on Windows platform (a path can be converted to native instead).\n\n\n## List of Error Codes and Meanings\nWhen an error is thrown, one of the following codes will be used.\n\n| Code | Constant                      |\n|-----:|:------------------------------|\n|    1 | `NOT_FOUND_ERR`               |\n|    2 | `SECURITY_ERR`                |\n|    3 | `ABORT_ERR`                   |\n|    4 | `NOT_READABLE_ERR`            |\n|    5 | `ENCODING_ERR`                |\n|    6 | `NO_MODIFICATION_ALLOWED_ERR` |\n|    7 | `INVALID_STATE_ERR`           |\n|    8 | `SYNTAX_ERR`                  |\n|    9 | `INVALID_MODIFICATION_ERR`    |\n|   10 | `QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR`          |\n|   11 | `TYPE_MISMATCH_ERR`           |\n|   12 | `PATH_EXISTS_ERR`             |\n\n## Configuring the Plugin (Optional)\n\nThe set of available filesystems can be configured per-platform. Both iOS and\nAndroid recognize a <preference> tag in `config.xml` which names the\nfilesystems to be installed. By default, all file-system roots are enabled.\n\n    <preference name=\"iosExtraFilesystems\" value=\"library,library-nosync,documents,documents-nosync,cache,bundle,root\" />\n    <preference name=\"AndroidExtraFilesystems\" value=\"files,files-external,documents,sdcard,cache,cache-external,root\" />\n\n### Android\n\n* `files`: The application's internal file storage directory\n* `files-external`: The application's external file storage directory\n* `sdcard`: The global external file storage directory (this is the root of the SD card, if one is installed). You must have the `android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission to use this.\n* `cache`: The application's internal cache directory\n* `cache-external`: The application's external cache directory\n* `root`: The entire device filesystem\n\nAndroid also supports a special filesystem named \"documents\", which represents a \"/Documents/\" subdirectory within the \"files\" filesystem.\n\n### iOS\n\n* `library`: The application's Library directory\n* `documents`: The application's Documents directory\n* `cache`: The application's Cache directory\n* `bundle`: The application's bundle; the location of the app itself on disk (read-only)\n* `root`: The entire device filesystem\n\nBy default, the library and documents directories can be synced to iCloud. You can also request two additional filesystems, `library-nosync` and `documents-nosync`, which represent a special non-synced directory within the `/Library` or `/Documents` filesystem.\n",
